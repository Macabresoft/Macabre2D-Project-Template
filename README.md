# Macabre2D Project / Template

This is a template for a Macabre2D project.

Generally, you will want to start a project with a project template. The default template can be found [here](https://github.com/Macabresoft/Macabre2D-Project-Template).

It is recommended you maintain everything in the Project folder as a separate repository from Macabre2D. Macabre2D is setup to ignore this folder by default. If you don't wish to share changes with Macabre2D, it is perfectly acceptable to remove the /Project/ line from Macabre2D's .gitnore and keep a single repository.
